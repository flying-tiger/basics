# basics
Some basic utilities for working in Python. It's just a colleciton of simple
classes and functions that I use regularly, organized into a one-module package
that I can easily drop into new projects.

## To Do
1. Add type support for NamedTupleReader.
2. Add a "zip_equal" function; like zip that errors if lists not equal length.
